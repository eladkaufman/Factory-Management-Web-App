# Factory Management Web App
 My first end-to-end project! ðŸŽ‰
 
 ## Introduction
This app is used to manage a factory.  
The factory has *departments*.  
Each dapartment has *employees*.  
The employees work in *shifts*.  
*users* are presons who uses the app, and pre-defines in the system.
Each user has a maximun number of actions they can do in a day. When a user exceed is allowed actions for the day, the system throws them out to the log-in page, and they are banned for the rest of the day(no worries- they can log-in again the day after).

## Technolegies in use

The server-side is a REST API written in C# using ASP.NET.  
The database was created using Microsost SQL Server Managemet Studio, scheme provided in "Database" section.
